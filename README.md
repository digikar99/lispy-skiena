# A lispy approach to Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual

Well, okay, the only lispy thing about this is we use [iterate](https://digikar99.github.io/common-lisp.readthedocs/iterate/). I feel \*everyone\*
must be aware of iterate - possibly use such "high level" iteration techologies while
writing (pseudo)code.

Besides, making things lispy, another reason this repository is in existence is for notes for myself - and possibly others.
